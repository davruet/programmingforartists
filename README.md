## Class description

Learning to program allows artists to write their own rules in a world governed by technical systems. As the physical and the virtual blend ever more seamlessly, the world becomes programmable, creating new creative opportunities and challenges. This class will introduce artists to the technical and conceptual skills needed to disassemble, scrutinize, disable, short-circuit, repurpose, and re-imagine the technologies that form the digital status quo.

Over the course of the quarter, we will build programming skills using Processing, a popular development environment for creative coding, and Arduino, a prototyping platform for digital electronic objects that interact with the physical world. Beyond the fundamentals of programming, the class will investigate contemporary software technologies that relate to four core topic areas: vision, sound, body, and network. We will develop philosophical, historical, and artistic contexts for these technical programming concepts through brief readings, lectures on contemporary art, independent student research, and class discussions.

Working individually and in groups, students will complete and present for critique a series of artistic experiments, a midterm project, and a final project developed through individual consultations with the instructor. Independent research into relevant art, ideas, technologies, and histories should inspire this work, and students will be expected to share their ongoing research on a personal blog. Grading will be based on participation (in sharing of research, discussions, and critiques), and successful completion of assigned projects. 


## Class goals

Students will develop technical skills in computer programming and digital electronics design by creating experiments in art and technology that connect with current conversations in contemporary art and theory. 

## Assignments

### Weekly experiments

Each week, the class will learn new technologies by making things. We'll begin with workshops that introduce technical knowledge needed to get started. These workshops will be starting points for experiments, which students will continue to develop on their own. 

Weekly experiments will not be graded, but students will be expected to briefly share their work and discuss their results with the class. 


### Remake

For this project, students will reproduce a conceptual artwork originally made in the 1950s, 60s, or 70s. The reproduction or re-enactment will explore what it means to re-make the original in a new technological context.

For example, see Lauren McCarthy's recent work [Follower](http://lauren-mccarthy.com/Follower), and consider the ways it both references and extends Vito Acconci's [Following Piece](http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/283737)(1969) and Sophie Calle's [Suite VÃ©nitienne](http://sigliopress.com/book/suite-venitienne/) (1980).

More details for this project's requirements will be supplied in a formal assignment description.

### Final project

The final project will be a self-directed artwork developed in consultation with the instructor. More details for this project's requirements will be supplied in a formal assignment description.

### Documentation
Midterm and final projects must be documented using screen captures, photography, video, or any other applicable technique. Any necessary project documentation must be posted to the class blog before class begins. Documentation will count as part of the project grade.


## Evaluation

### Overall grade
* Participation in discussion, workshops, and critiques: 30%
* Experiments: 20% (5% each, credit/no-credit)
* Midterm Project: 20% (due 11/3/2016)
* Final Project: 30% (due 11/29/2016)

Extra credit may be given (at the instructor's discretion) for work that demonstrates exceptional effort or engagement with the assigned project.

### Project grading

Class projects are opportunities to explore new ideas and techniques. Unfortunately, grades can discourage students from taking risks in artmaking. To counter this, project evaluations in this class will prioritize inventiveness, energy, curiosity, ambition, criticality, and creative risk-taking over engineering quality. A technically sound project that doesn't experiment beyond conventional ideas and approaches may receive a C, while a partially failed but exceptionally creative effort may receive an A.

Midterm and final projects will be graded according to these criteria:

**Successful work:**

* Original and demonstrates substantial effort and research. 
* In critiques, the student demonstrates knowledge of the work's context and connections in art history, philosophy, contemporary culture, and any other relevant fields of knowledge.
* Both the work and the student's comments about it show an appreciation for nuance, ambiguity, and multiplicity of meaning.
* Processes, materials, and aesthetic choices made in the work demonstrate consideration in relation to the subject matter.

**Less-successful work:**

* Meets the assignment's requirements, but doesn't go much beyond.
* Fails to respond to or engage with prior relevant critiques brought up by instructor or classmates.
* Reiterates a perspective or message that is commonplace in popular culture or art, without complication or critical re-interpretation.


A failing grade will be reserved for work that does not meet the assignment's basic requirements, and for projects where the student fails to demonstrate a significant engagement with the technologies or their chosen subject matter.


### Class participation guidelines

* Come to class prepared to discuss the day's assigned reading, and share any relevant references.
* Actively participate in class discussions and critiques: be generous with attention, and work to generate constructive discussions. 
* Work to make sure that critiques and discussions are helpful, inclusive spaces where everyone's voice can be heard. 
* Contribute references relevant to class discussions and exercises to the class blog: <http://programmingforartists.wordpress.com>

## Attendance

Attendance is mandatory. Students who miss a class (for any reason) will be responsible for learning the material covered.

Students are requested to be considerate of fellow classmates and arrive in the classroom before 12PM. Each two unexcused tardinesses will count as one unexcused absence. Leaving class early will count as an unexcused tardiness. 

A student's first unexcused absence will not count against their grade, but further unexcused absences will, as follows:

* 2 unexcused absences: -5%
* 3 unexcused absences: -10%

Students who have four or more unexcused absences will fail the class.

### Critique absences (midterm and final)
Critiques are an indispensable part of assigned class projects. Students who miss a critique day or do not present work will have one week to turn in the project for half credit. Assignments turned in later than one week past the deadline will not be accepted. No critiques will be rescheduled for unexcused absences or incomplete work.

Students who are ill, or have another acceptable reason (from the list below) to miss class on a critique day, must contact the instructor **before** the missed class for their absence to be considered excused. The instructor will attempt to make an accommodation and schedule a new critique to make up for the one missed, but this may not be possible in all cases.

### Excused absences
Absences will be considered excused if **(a)** the student is ill and notifies the instructor in advance of the absence, or **(b)** the student provides the instructor with an absence letter from a medical professional, family member, or University official. Acceptable reasons for absence include: illness, family emergency, religious holidays, and formal participation in scheduled activities of University groups.

## Safety

While risk-taking in most cases is encouraged, students must never risk the safety or well-being of themselves or others. Any potentially dangerous project or action (especially those involving 110VAC wall power wiring in any way) must be cleared with the instructor first, to ensure that all necessary safety precautions are taken.

## Disability access

The University of Oregon is an equal opportunity, affirmative action institution committed to cultural diversity and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. If you have a documented disability and anticipate needing accommodations in this course, please make arrangements to meet with the Accessible Education Center (AEC) and notify the instructor during the first week of class.
The AEC can be reached at:
Phone: 541.346.1155 | E-mail: uoaec@uoregon.edu | Office is located in 164 Oregon Hall

This syllabus will be made available in alternative formats upon request.


## Sharing documentation of work

Projects created in this course may be used by the Department of Art for purposes of promotion for students, the Department, or the University in general. The Department may also use these materials for instructional purposes in future courses. The instructor may also use documentation of student projects as examples of work completed in the class.

## Changes

This syllabus is provisional. Topics, dates, and schedules may change depending on the needs and interests of the class. Project due dates, required readings, and graded assignment descriptions will not be changed without advance notification in class or via email.

The latest syllabus will always be available on the class Github page:
